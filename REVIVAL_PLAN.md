# 🚀 React Native FFmpeg Revival Plan

## 🎯 **Opportunity**

The original `react-native-ffmpeg` package is:

- ✅ **Abandoned** - Archived since Oct 7, 2021
- ✅ **Deprecated** - Points to ffmpeg-kit-react-native (now also retired)
- ✅ **Perfect timing** - FFmpegKit just retired (Jan 6, 2025)
- ✅ **Community need** - Thousands still using it with build issues

## 📋 **Your Complete Solution**

You have created:

- ✅ **Working smart-exception-java replacement**
- ✅ **Zero-config postinstall script**
- ✅ **Complete package** (`@sheehanmunim/react-native-ffmpeg`)
- ✅ **Proven testing** - All tests pass
- ✅ **Published and ready** - Available on npm

## 🎯 **Revival Strategy**

### **Option 1: Official Takeover (Best)**

**Contact Taner Sener:**

- **GitHub:** https://github.com/tanersener
- **Medium:** https://tanersener.medium.com/
- **Package:** https://www.npmjs.com/~tanersener

**Proposal Message:**

```
Hi Taner,

I saw your announcement about retiring FFmpegKit. Thank you for all your amazing work on FFmpeg for mobile platforms!

I've created a complete solution that solves the Android build issues that many React Native developers face with the deprecated react-native-ffmpeg package. It includes:

- Working smart-exception-java replacement
- Zero-configuration setup
- Automatic Android build fixes
- Drop-in replacement API

Package: @sheehanmunim/react-native-ffmpeg (already published)
GitHub: https://github.com/sheehanmunim/react-native-ffmpeg

Would you be interested in transferring the original react-native-ffmpeg package to me so I can revive it for the community? This would help thousands of developers who are still struggling with the deprecated package.

Best regards,
Sheehan
```

### **Option 2: Community Fork**

If Taner doesn't respond or transfer:

1. **Create community fork**
2. **Publish under new scope** (already done: `@sheehanmunim/react-native-ffmpeg`)
3. **Create issue in original repo** announcing the maintained fork
4. **Build community support**

## 🔄 **Migration Path to Original Package Name**

### **If Transfer Succeeds:**

1. **Update original repo** with your solution
2. **Publish new version** of `react-native-ffmpeg`
3. **Keep both packages** for transition period
4. **Deprecate scoped package** pointing to original

### **Package Version Strategy:**

- Original was `0.5.2` (based on FFmpeg 4.4)
